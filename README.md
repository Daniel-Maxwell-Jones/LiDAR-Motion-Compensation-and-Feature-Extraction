# LiDAR-Motion-Compensation-and-Feature-Extraction
A set of MATLAB functions capable of characterizing the shape of object in point cloud data captured from a LiDAR sensor situated in a moving reference frame.

## Navigating this repository
### Helper_Functions
The Helper_Functions folder contains all of the functions created to exctract the data from ROS1 bag files as well as compensate for the motion of the LiDAR and extract the parameters from the scene. More detailed explanations regarding the functionality and implimentation of these functions is provided in the Function_Descriptions file in the Helper_Functions folder. 
### Simulations
The scripts contained within the Simulations folder allow one to create point cloud scenes to test both motion compensation and and feature extraction algorithms. Instructions on how to use these simulation scripts can be found in the Simulation_Instructions file in the Simulations directory.
### Experiments_Code
This folder contains the scripts used to evaluate the performence of the Helper_Functions. These can further serve as examples of how to implement the helper functions.
